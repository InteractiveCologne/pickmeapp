##The Essential & simple communication tool for everyone
It's 4am.  You can't see anymore, everything blurry, but you are happy!  You are drunk!  You wanna have fun, and you wish your friends were with you too.  Try to find them on your phone, call or text them, wait for a response...  Yeah good luck with that...  

Enter pickmeapp!  Pickmeapp will do all that for you.

Pickmeapp is a tool for communicating with your custom contact lists for any occasion.  What's different about Pickmeapp than other messengers is that it keeps things simple.  It takes us back to the days of American Indians using just smoke to communicate with each other.  Pickmeapp, in the same sense, just sends a message to your selected people with only one button, and they respond or not.  No messaging, no songs.  No fuss, no mas.

###Some Features
- One button to send a ping or a message to masses
- Custom contact lists
- Different occasion settings for contact lists
- Works on IOS & Android
- Simple!
- Effective!
